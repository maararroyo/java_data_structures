# Java Data Structures 

This repository contains a collection of Java exercises focused on strengthening our understanding of **data structures**, **algorithm design**, and core **object-oriented programming** principles. All of the problems are implemented using **NetBeans**.

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents a self-contained exercise. Below is a brief description of each:

### `BasicCalculator`
- Implements basic arithmetic functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).
- Practice with modularization and input validation.

### `CircleArea`
- Calculates the area of a circle using `Math.PI`.
- Covers use of `double`, user input, and arithmetic operations.

### `CompareTwoNumbers`
- Compares two integers and prints whether they are equal, or which one is greater.
- Uses conditional logic (`if`, `else if`, `else`).

### `CountOccurrencesLogs`
- Counts how many times each user appears in a simulated log (e.g., `"user1 login"`).
- Involves string parsing (`split()`), `HashMap`, and iteration.

### `CountVocales`
- Counts the number of vowels in a given sentence.
- Covers loops, conditionals, and character-level logic.

### `Cuenta`
- Auxiliary or development folder.

### `FibonacciSeries`
- Prints the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Practice with iterative logic and basic algorithm design.

### `FilterRecentEventsTimestamp`
- Filters out log events that occurred more than 24 hours ago using `LocalDateTime`.
- Excellent simulation of time-based filtering in backend systems or event streams.

### `FizzBuzz`
- Classic interview problem: prints “Fizz”, “Buzz”, or “FizzBuzz” based on divisibility by 3 and 5.
- Involves loops and conditional statements.

### `InvertirCadena`
- Reverses a string entered by the user.
- Practice with `String` manipulation and `charAt()` usage.

### `JavaApplication53`
- Temporary folder generated by NetBeans.

### `KeyWordSuggestion`
- Simulates an autocomplete system similar to Amazon's search bar.
- Uses list filtering, alphabetical sorting, `startsWith()`, and substring matching.

### `OrderArrayBubbleSort`
- Manual implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- Demonstrates sorting logic and nested loops, with time complexity O(n²).

### `Palindromo`
- Checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
- Involves character comparisons and `equalsIgnoreCase()`.

### `PrimeNumbers`
- Determines if a given number is a prime.
- Basic math, iteration, and early exit logic.

### `SearchNumberArray`
- Checks whether a user-entered number exists in a given array.
- Demonstrates linear search and conditional logic.

## How to Run the Exercises

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/java_data_structures.git

2. Open each folder in NetBeans (each contains its own build.xml and src).

3. Locate and run the class containing the main() method for each project.
